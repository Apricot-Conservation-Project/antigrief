### Lag eradicator

Helps reduce lag on your server. At the moment this plugin features the following:


 - Mono-spam prevention. Monos no longer spawn and instead are just added to 
   a simple counter that generates resources for that team every 10 seconds. The limit on the monos is identical to
   the normal limit placed on them when creating them in game (with the exception of the Crux team, Crux does not get
   infinite monos)
